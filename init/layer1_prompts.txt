- Injection
- Memory Management
- Pointer Dereference
- Integer Errors

- Match code fragments against known vulnerability signatures (unsafe string copies, unchecked format strings, unsanitized SQL, etc.).
- Separate Buffer Errors from Pointer Dereference by verifying whether the bug stems from bounds mistakes or invalid pointer lifetime.

- Path Traversal
- Cryptography Issues
- Information Exposure

### ANALYSIS GUIDANCE START
- Highlight characteristic cues for each category: bounds violations, use-after-free markers, SQL concatenation, race-prone locks, etc.
- Use decision points: if buffer size math is unsafe → Buffer Errors; if user strings reach exec/SQL → Injection; if free/alloc pair misaligns → Memory Management.
- Escalate ambiguous cases to 'Other' only after exhausting specific category signatures.
- Return 'Benign' when all characteristic cues are absent or mitigated.
